    <td>I learnt this lesson by mainly doing practical work and filling in a python worksheet that our teacher gave us. This meant that we had to do a lot of thinking for ourselves and asking, although we did have a slides at the front which our teacher went through, this was quite helpful and made me understand a little bit about 'if' statements. I think that the most effective way of learning this lesson was thinking for myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I limited my learning by consistently asking around for help, which I could have easily found out the answer for myself. This means that I was slowing my learning down. I know need to work on controlling myself and telling myself that it will be a lot more satisfactory if I did it independently.</td>
