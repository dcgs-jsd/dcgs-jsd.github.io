    <td>Since I had no prior knowledge about how to use functions, I had to two options, look it up online or ask a friend who knows stuff about this subject. I went to both but on finding that the internet is too complicated in spite of it having "for beginners" in the title, I went to my peers, it took me along time and now I sort of understand, not, what functions are. </td>

    <td>I think that I could have understood the article about functions had I really tried but I guess I was tired and so went to the easier option. </td>

    <td>I will change the way I approached this challenge as I could have understood functions had I went for the harder option. </td>
