  <tr>
    <td>I used resources on Google Classroom to help me create a jekyll blog and to use Gabriel.
The most effective way of learning was taking notes and using them to start up my blog. I also thought that if I needed help I would speak to my peers.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my conversations with my peers limited my learning if they strayed from the subject. This was only possible because the conversations went on for too long. So I could work on making sure that my conversations with my peers are short but full of information.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I approached this challenge, this time I will take note of the information needed and make sure I understand it all so I can have a undisrupted lesson. This will also help me focus and improve the way I learn.</td>
