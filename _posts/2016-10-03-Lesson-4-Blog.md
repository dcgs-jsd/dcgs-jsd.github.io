    <td> I found that learning by engaging my brain helped a lot. Also I found that talking to someone when I was in need of help earned me a lot of knowledge as well. One of my strategies was to edit my blog then run it and see if it did what I wanted it to do, if i didn't I would have a failed website. Which wasn’t so good but helped me in the long run because I could find out what went wrong, why, how and what needed to do to get a working blog.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think when I didn’t engage my brain the whole point of what I was supposed to do kind of crashed and burned although it did prompt me to try out some things that I would never usually do. I think this means I need to switch my brain off when I am not meant to be doing some work and switch it on when I am meant to be doing some work. </td>

    <td>I will change the way I approached this challenge and instead of changing things that don’t need to be changed I will understand the problem and approach it in a way where I use my brain not my addiction to funny colours.</td>
