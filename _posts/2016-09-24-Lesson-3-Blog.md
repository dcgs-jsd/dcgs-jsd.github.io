    <td>I learnt via the teachers and the websites that they had recommended. I think that writing down the information and putting it into play was effective but also I I think that asking my peers helped quite a bit too.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I limited my learning by showing my peers my blog and what I had done instead of concentrating on what I hadn't done. I need to work on by attention to the task in hand and not stray to far from the point.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I talked to my peers. This will encourage me to work independently and will improve the amount of work I go through per lesson so I wonâ€™t have much homework. </td>
