    <td>Although I wasn't there in the lesson I found out that, in the lesson we refined our blog in the first 5 mins and started on the spreadsheets. I learned by asking my fellow peers and checking the information with other people. My strategy worked, it was checking the information against other people.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I limited my learning by not going to the teacher but it did encourage me to ask more. I also limited my learning by asking 2 days before the work was due in. This means I need to work on being proactive.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will change the way I went into the challenge of missing a lesson. I will improve my learning by looking up the work we are supposed to do and looking at other people's work, examples. </td>
