    <td>Over the course of this half term I feel that I made a lot of progress in my blog and in my repl.it. This boosted my learning in the last half term of this year. It also was quite fun and it was a really good way to end the year. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I got sidetracked and fell to some buzzfeed quizzes, even though we could go on them, it wasted my time. This was what usually happened and although it was fun it wasn't very productive and so I didnâ€™t get the most out of it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next year, which is a very important year, I will try and maximise my learning and try and get the most out of it. This will set me up for the future and will ensure I get into good habits to follow for the rest of my life. </td>
