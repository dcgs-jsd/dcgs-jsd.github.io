    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a blog which looks good with a working colour scheme and the blog is written creatively and with style. (From the mark scheme)</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think I reached my target to an extent since I am not to sure about the “written with style” bit. </td>

    <td>In this lesson we were going over some people's blogs and I was full of fear that I was going to get picked, because I really dislike that kind of thing. I always manage to have butterflies in my stomach when we go through that but hey we always have to do stuff we don’t want to do otherwise we wouldn’t even be going to school. If this is being read out now well then wasup :) . If you look at me now I am probably red in the cheeks and shaking slightly. I think that I am going off track now, time to get back on track, this lesson I think that I learnt by understanding my peers mistakes and hoping that I haven’t made them too.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I limited my learning by thinking of the lesson as a lesson where I/other people get embarrassed because they are being put in front of a crowd of teenagers and hoping they don’t get laughed at. Whereas I should be thinking of this lesson as a lesson where I get to learn from the mistakes, I most definitely made, and improve.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I thought of the lesson as, not a comedy show where I get laughed at, but as a chance to be encouraged to do well in front of my peers. This will, hopefully, improve my learning by a drastic amount because I will have a urge to do well.</td>
