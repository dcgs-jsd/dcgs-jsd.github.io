How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to my teacher ,with great interest, about how spreadsheets are used in the real world and how every company uses them. The strategy I used in that lesson  was about how I would listen to the teacher whilst taking notes. I think that worked. But the whole lesson was about how we as children should be more independent and take action for ourselves.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on using my initiative and how to use my brain before I open my mouth. I limited my learning by increasing my mouth usage whereas limiting my brain usage. I also need to work on asking my peers and/or google if I needed help.</td>

    <td>I will change the way I approached the lesson I won't go in there and expect to do the same thing every lesson but I will go in expecting to do incredible things. This will improve my learning because I will go in knowing that this lesson will help me in the future</td>
