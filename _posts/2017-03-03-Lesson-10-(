    <td>This was more of a listening lesson since our teacher talked to us on computational thinking and critical thinking. I thought that this was quite informative. Our teacher then showed us optical illusions and showed us a TED talk on how we can't trust our own eyes, the things that show us the way. This lesson I think the homework encouraged me to learn my learning since I didn't know where to start. But then I remembered that I have most of the world knowledge at my fingertips, if my fingertips are touching a keyboard, which is connected to a computer, which is connected to the internet, which has safari. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I limited my learning  by not listening as intently as I could have done during the TED talk. This probably slowed down my ability to learn and I think that I need to work on paying attention to videos as I usually get distracted. </td>

    <td>I will change the way I approached my homework which should speed up my learning and I will apply my computational learning, which I learn in class , which should speed me up. </td>
