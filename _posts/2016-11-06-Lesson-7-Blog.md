    <td>This lesson I learnt mainly via the teacher because it was something that was very hard, for me, to learn from the internet. So one of my strategies was that I would listen to the teacher and when he was demonstrating I would write down the information I had gathered in that short section. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One thing that limited my learning was that was easily distracted, either by the chair on just the general background noise. Another thing that limited my learning was the fact that I did not put my hand up when I didn't understand some of the things the teacher was saying.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that put my hand up if I donâ€™t understand something. That will improve my learning because I will understand more, so I will be able to improve my work. I will also make sure that I get a full night of sleep so I will be more attentive.</td>
