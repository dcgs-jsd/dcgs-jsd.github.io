    <td>I learn't by engaging with my peers and understanding what worked and what didn’t. I think they were effective because I found out what code to change and what code not to change. I also took notes to remind me what needed to do during the lesson. This was effective because then I didn’t have to constantly ask the teacher and my peers about what to do. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I needed to work on being efficient and not showing my work to my peers to often and engaging in conversations which weren’t related to the work. I also need to work on understanding what I need to do not just guessing which code to change.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I approached my peers and the way I wrote notes down. I will improve my learning by not guessing about what to do, instead asking around or looking the information I need on the internet. This will also improve my independent learning.</td>
